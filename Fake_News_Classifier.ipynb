Hornberger   As US officials continue to accuse Russia of meddling with the US presidential election, an accusation that they have provided no evidence whatsoever to support, let\\u2019s review some of the US government\\u2019s history of meddling with elections in others countries.1. In 1951, the democratically elected parliament of Iran elected a man named Mohammad Mossadegh to be Iran\\u2019s prime minister. Mossadegh angered British Empire officials by nationalizing British oil interests in the country.British officials then turned to the CIA for assistance. In 1953, the CIA secretly fomented a violent coup in Iran, which succeeded in ousting Mossadegh from power and making the Shah of Iran the supreme unelected dictator of the country.To fortify the Shah\\u2019s dictatorial hold on power, the CIA helped organize and train the his domestic police force, the Savak, which was essentially a combination of the CIA, the NSA, and the military. Part of the CIA\\u2019s training involved teaching Savak agents the art of torture.For the next 26 years, the Iranian people suffered under one of the most brutal and tyrannical dictatorships in the world, one that US officials fully supported and called an ally and friend of the United States.In 1979, Iranians successfully revolted against the Shah\\u2019s regime and ousted him from power. One result was not a restoration of the democratic system that had elected Mossadegh but rather another brutal dictatorship, this time a religious one. Another result is the bad relations between the Iran and US governments that continues to exist today.2. In 1951, the Guatemalan people democratically elected a man named Jacobo Arbenz to be their president. Arbenz, however, was not satisfactory to US officials, especially the national-security branch of the government, specifically the Pentagon and the CIA. The reason that US officials opposed Arbenz was that he was a socialist, and US officials considered a socialist president of Guatemala to be a threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States.In 1954 \\u2014 one year after the coup in Iran, the CIA fomented a violent military coup that succeeded in removing Arbenz from power and replacing him with one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in Latin American history, a man named Carlos Castillo Armas. The CIA had a kill list prepared for the coup, which Arbenz was able to escape by fleeing the country before Castillo was able to get him. The CIA\\u2019s destruction of Guatemala\\u2019s democratic system threw the nation into a 30-year civil war that ended up killing millions of Guatemalan people, especially many of the poor.3. In 1960 a man named Patrice Lamumba was elected Congo\\u2019s first prime minister after independence from Belgium. Lamumba spoke out against Western imperialism and refused to take sides in the Cold War, which caused the CIA to conclude that he was a threat to \\u201cnational security.\\u201d The CIA orchestrated the assassination of Lamumba, which ended up taking place on January 17, 1961, just three days before President Kennedy, who liked Lamumba and who would have ordered the CIA to stand down, was to be sworn into office.4. In 1970 a man named Salvador Allende received a plurality of votes in the presidential election in Chile. Pursuant to the Chilean constitution, the election was thrown into the national congress. President Richard Nixon, his national-security team, the Pentagon, and the CIA concluded that because Allende believed in communism and socialism, he posed a grave threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States. The CIA attempted to bribe members of the congress to vote against Allende. It also orchestrated the kidnapping of the head of Chile\\u2019s armed forces, Gen Rene Schneider, who opposed a US military coup in his country, especially since a coup would violate the country\\u2019s constitution. The kidnapping attempt on Schneider left him dead.The CIA then fomented a coup that took place on 9/11 1973 that violently ousted Allende from power and left him dead. Replacing him was army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in history. By the time Pinochet\\u2019s 17-year reign of military terror came to an end in 1990, he and his CIA-supported goons had incarcerated, raped, tortured, or killed tens of thousands of innocent people \\u2014 that is, people whose only \\u201ccrime\\u201d was believing in socialism \\u2014 with the full support of the CIA, Pentagon, Nixon, and his \\u201cnational security\\u201d team.Of course, there are also the more recent support of regime-change operations that ousted democratically elected presidents that the US government disapproved of, such as in Ukraine and Egypt.And then there is the long list of countries where unelected dictators were targeted for regime change by the US national security state and, where successful, replaced with a brutal unelected pro-US dictator. Cuba, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria all come to mind.US officials need to keep in mind that when they point their accusatory index finger at Russia for supposedly meddling in the US presidential election, US officials have, at the same time, three fingers pointing back at themselves.

Well, the three terrorists who attacked London Bridge over the weekend found the Black and Blue Steakhouse, and they found the toughest man in the house. [Or, maybe more to the point, he found them.  Roy Larner, 47, is a huge fan of the South East London soccer team Millwall F. C. The team is known as the Lions, and when   terrorists entered the Black and Blue to kill innocent people, Larner let them know who is the true king of the jungle. After the terrorists entered, with obvious bad intentions, Larner sprang into action: \\u201cLike an idiot I shouted back at them. I thought, \\u2018I need to take the p*** out of these b*****s.\\u2019 \\u201cI took a few steps towards them and said, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall.\\u2019 So they started attacking me. \\u201cI stood in front of them trying to fight them off. Everyone else ran to the back. I was on my own against all three of them, that\\u2019s why I got hurt so much. It was just me, trying to grab them with my bare hands and hold on. I was swinging. \\u201cI got stabbed and sliced eight times. They got me in my head, chest and both hands. There was blood everywhere. \\u201cThey were saying, \\u2018Islam, Islam!\\u2019 I said again, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u2019 \\u201cIt was the worst thing I could have done as they carried on attacking me. \\u201cLuckily, none of the blows were straight at me or I\\u2019d be dead. \\u201d A petition has begun, with the aim of awarding Larner with the George Cross for bravery.

I think subconsciously people understand to be a \\u201cDoctor\\u201d is to be a teacher, but on the surface most people find it odd and uncomfortable to accept my interest and quest in something that rarely occurs to them. \\nOccasionally, there will be debate. I don\\u2019t necessarily look for them. Experience with humans of all ages and from all walks of life has afforded me a healthy dose of humility. But I\\u2019m happy and proud to go as far as anyone would like about money, finance and especially silver. \\nNo matter how tempting it is, no matter how strong the need is to be right and to feel vindicated, it is normally fruitless. I don\\u2019t know where I first heard it, but one of my favorite expressions has become: \\n\\u201cI can explain it to you, but I can\\u2019t understand it for you.\\u201d \\nUnderstanding requires a shift. One that, I feel myself almost cringing to admit, involves emotional intelligence. This goes against all rational logic. \\nMost people are polite. And I\\u2019ll admit to a tendency for avoiding conflict \\u2014 especially given the context in which many of these (potential) debates typically arise. \\nI came across the following article by accident some time back . It immediately resonated with my own experience in wrestling with my own beliefs, but also the beliefs, world views, and opinions of people I care about. \\nAnd collectively speaking, the opinions and views of anyone with a pulse who cares about financial safety, justice, and wealth. \\nYou are, I\\u2019m afraid to say, mistaken. The position you are taking makes no logical sense. Just listen up and I\\u2019ll be more than happy to elaborate on the many, many reasons why I\\u2019m right and you are wrong. Are you feeling ready to be convinced? \\nWhether the subject is climate engineering, the Middle East or forthcoming holiday plans, this is the approach many of us adopt when we try to convince others to change their minds. It\\u2019s also an approach that, more often than not, leads to the person on the receiving end hardening their existing position. \\n(Ed. For the subject of money and wealth, at the root lies the fear of loss \\u2013 more powerful than the want of profit. People will do anything, and convince themselves of practically anything, to avoid loss.) \\nFortunately, research suggests there is a better way \\u2013 one that involves more listening and less trying to bludgeon your opponent into submission. \\nA little over a decade ago Leonid Rozenblit and Frank Keil from Yale University suggested that in many instances people believe they understand how something works when in fact their understanding is superficial at best. \\nThey called this phenomenon \\u201cthe illusion of explanatory depth\\u201d. \\nThey began by asking their study participants to rate how well they understood how things like flushing toilets, car speedometers and sewing machines worked before asking them to explain what they understood and then answer questions on it. \\nThe effect they revealed was that, on average, people in the experiment rated their understanding as much worse after it had been put to the test. \\nWhat happens, argued the researchers, is that we mistake our familiarity with these things for the belief that we have a detailed understanding of how they work. \\n(I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019ve experienced this with the topic of money and currency. We use the terms interchangeably, though they are very different in reality. I\\u2019ll never forget the transformation I witnessed in a \\u201cBitcoin aficionado\\u201d \\u2013 arriving from the technological side of things \\u2013 coming to grips with the store of wealth versus currency.) \\nUsually, nobody tests us and if we have any questions about them we can just take a look. Psychologists call this idea that humans have a tendency to take mental shortcuts when making decisions or assessments the \\u201ccognitive miser\\u201d theory. \\nWhy would we bother expending the effort to really understand things when we can get by without doing so? The interesting thing is that we manage to hide from ourselves exactly how shallow our understanding is. \\nIt\\u2019s a phenomenon that will be familiar to anyone who has ever had to teach something. Usually, it only takes the first moments when you start to rehearse what you\\u2019ll say to explain a topic (or worse, the first student question) for you to realize that you don\\u2019t truly understand it. \\nAll over the world, teachers say to each other \\u201cI didn\\u2019t really understand this until I had to teach it.\\u201d Or as researcher and inventor Mark Changizi quipped: \\u201cI find that no matter how badly I teach I still learn something.\\u201d \\nExplain Yourself \\nResearch published last year on this illusion of understanding shows how the effect might be used to convince others they are wrong. \\nThe research team, led by Philip Fernbach of the University of Colorado, reasoned that the phenomenon might hold as much for political understanding as for things like how toilets work. \\nPerhaps, they figured, people who have strong political opinions would be more open to other viewpoints, if asked to explain exactly how they thought the policy they were advocating would bring about the effects they claimed it would. \\nRecruiting a sample of Americans via the internet, they polled participants on a set of contentious U.S. policy issues, such as imposing sanctions on Iran, healthcare and approaches to carbon emissions. \\nOne group was asked to give their opinion and then provide reasons for why they held that view. This group got the opportunity to put their side of the issue, in the same way anyone in an argument or debate has a chance to argue their case. \\nThose in the second group did something subtly different. Rather than provide reasons, they were asked to explain how the policy they were advocating would work. They were asked to trace, step by step, from start to finish, the causal path from the policy to the effects it was supposed to have. \\nThe results were clear. People who provided reasons remained as convinced of their positions as they had been before the experiment. Those who were asked to provide explanations softened their views, and reported a correspondingly larger drop in how they rated their understanding of the issues.\",\n          \"So-called \\u2018Patient Zero\\u2019 not behind the spread of HIV in US Published time: 27 Oct, 2016 00:50 Get short URL Ga\\u00ebtan Dugas (February 20, 1953 \\u2013 March 30, 1984), Canadian flight attendant and alleged patient zero for AIDS. \\u00a9 Wikipedia Since 1987, the so-called \\u201cPatient Zero\\u201d of HIV was believed to be a Canadian flight attendant, blamed for importing the virus that causes AIDS into the US. New research has determined that he was not the first infected person in the US, however. \\nGaetan Dugas has been blamed for the appearance of AIDS in the US. However, research from the University of Arizona has exonerated Dugas, no longer the first villain in the deadly epidemic. \\nDugas was first identified as \\u201c Patient Zero \\u201d in Randy Shilts\\u2019 1987 bestseller about the AIDS epidemic, titled \\u2018And the Band Played On.\\u2019 The former Air Canada flight attendant died of AIDS in 1984, but new discoveries about the genetic makeup of the AIDS virus have revealed that Dugas was not the source of the infection in the US, merely another victim of the disease during its earliest days. New antibody therapy suppresses #HIV for 2+ months without side effects \\u2013 study https://t.co/bZWJQrHf5o pic.twitter.com/8YFtN0oK8w \\u2014 RT America (@RT_America) June 25, 2016 \\nMichael Worobey, the evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, led the study that pieced together the genetic sequence of the HIV virus, using eight blood samples collected from gay and bisexual men during a hepatitis B study between 1978 and 1979, Reuters reported . \\nWhat Worobey and his team discovered was that AIDS first came to the US by way of the Caribbean in 1970 or 1971. Instead of originating in California and spreading eastward via Dugas, as it was long believed, the spread of AIDS was actually the opposite. \\nDugas did link cases in New York City to California and was found to carry HIV-1 sequences attributed to early mutations of the infection, but the study found \\u201c no evidence that Patient O was the first person infected by this lineage. \\u201d \\n\\\" The virus got to New York City pretty darn early ,\\\" Worobey told NPR. \\nDugas\\u2019 reputation for being the first AIDS patient did not come from science, but rather a simple misinterpretation of the letter \\u201c O. \\u201d The urban legend began in the early 1980s, when behavioral scientist William Darrow was working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to try to discover what was behind the mysterious deaths of gay men in Los Angeles, NPR reported. \\nDarrow caught a break when he learned of rumors that the early cases of AIDS actually involved lovers. \\n\\u201c Whoa! This is the first indication that we had that the disease might be sexually transmitted from one person to another ,\\\" Darrow told NPR. \\nDugas appeared on Darrow\\u2019s radar when three unconnected men named him as a lover. His name was mentioned by more men, until he was connected to eight early AIDS cases. \\nWhen Darrow went to write up his findings, he coded the men\\u2019s names to preserve their anonymity. The majority of them were from the Los Angeles area and were identified as such. \\n\\\" There was LA1, LA2 ... and so forth, \\\" Darrow explained. \\nBut when it came to the French-Canadian flight attendant, Dugas was identified as \\\"Patient O,\\u201d the outside-of-California case. That is an O, as in Oscar. Not a zero. \\n\\\" I never labeled him Patient Zero, \\u201d Darrow said. Insurers discriminating against HIV/AIDS patients via drug costs \\u2013 study http://t.co/kYYil7NjxZ pic.twitter.com/bs92vGJV54 \\u2014 RT America (@RT_America) January 29, 2015 \\nHowever, the designation caused some confusion back at the CDC, where someone referred to Dugas as \\u201c Patient Zero. \\u201d This error was not corrected and Darrow went with it, but explained that \\u201c Patient O \\u201d was meant to show \\u201c there was some person who was very important in this cluster of cases. \\\" \\nThis mistake followed Dugas even after his death. When Shilts first read about the Canadian, he originally believed he was described as \\u201c Patient O, \\u201d but then heard CDC employees call him \\u201c Patient Zero. \\u201d \\n\\u201cI thought, 'Ooh, that's catchy\\u2019,\\u201d he told Life magazine. \\nFrom that point onward, Dugas became known as \\u201c Patient Zero \\u201d in Shilts\\u2019 book. Amid the panic surrounding the disease, the media ran with Dugas being to blame for the epidemic and spread misinformation that the Canadian was the first person diagnosed with the disease in the US. \\nThe fact that Dugas\\u2019 HIV sequence offered little difference from the many other people who were infected at the time was often forgotten and his reputation as \\u201c Patient Zero \\u201d overshadowed the assistance he offered the CDC in recognizing and studying HIV, according to Darrow. \\n\\\" To me, there's something nice about going back and correcting the record, \\\" Worobeysays. \\\" He has been blamed for things that no one should be blamed for. \\\"\",\n          \"Hillary Clinton worked to campaign past the revived controversy around her email server on Sunday, casting herself as a resilient fighter as Donald J. Trump intensified his sweeping claims of corruption in the American justice system. The announcement by James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, of a new review of emails that may be linked to Mrs. Clinton overshadowed the candidates\\u2019 usual messages over the weekend. The news threw Mrs. Clinton and the Trump campaign into an unexpected debate over both her emails and Mr. Comey\\u2019s conduct, though only scant information has been made public about the substance of the F. B. I. \\u2019s activities. Campaigning in Florida, Mrs. Clinton appeared to group Mr. Comey\\u2019s surprise role in the presidential race with the flurry of partisan attacks that often mark the last days of political campaigns. Without mentioning Mr. Comey by name, Mrs. Clinton struck a defiant note at a nightclub in Wilton Manors, she invoked her mother\\u2019s admonition to \\u201cnever, ever quit. \\u201d \\u201cWe won\\u2019t be distracted, no matter what our opponents throw at us,\\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters, and we know how many people are counting on us. \\u201d At a black church in Fort Lauderdale, Mrs. Clinton urged voters to turn out in force to vote in order to reject \\u201ca negative, hateful, bigoted vision\\u201d on the other side of the race. If Mrs. Clinton has aimed to stifle interest in her emails, Mr. Trump has seized on Mr. Comey\\u2019s announcement with exuberant glee. At a rally on Sunday in Colorado, Mr. Trump called the disclosure a \\u201cbig bombshell\\u201d and predicted it would lift him in the polls. Having spent months criticizing both Mr. Comey and the Department of Justice for deciding not to press charges against Mrs. Clinton for her use of a private email server, Mr. Trump redirected his attack on Sunday, going after Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Mr. Trump accused Ms. Lynch of corruption for failing to indict Mrs. Clinton, claiming without evidence that Ms. Lynch had likely interfered with an investigation in the hope of retaining her job in a Clinton administration. \\u201cEffectively, you\\u2019d call that a bribe, wouldn\\u2019t you?\\u201d Mr. Trump asked at a speech in Las Vegas. Mr. Trump\\u2019s closest advisers stopped well short of his provocative claim. But on the Sunday news programs, allies of Mr. Trump, including his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, attempted to sow deeper doubts about Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s trustworthiness without explicitly attacking the justice system. Still, both sides  \\u2014   having scant information about what, exactly, Mr. Comey\\u2019s new review might entail  \\u2014   offered more insinuations than arguments with Election Day just nine days away. The code word for Mr. Pence was \\u201ctroubled\\u201d  \\u2014   a term he used freely on television to raise the notion, if not quite an accusation, that prosecutors had gone easy on Mrs. Clinton. \\u201cI\\u2019m one of millions of Americans that were troubled by that  \\u2014   why there\\u2019s this double standard when it comes to the Clintons,\\u201d Mr. Pence said on \\u201cMeet the Press\\u201d on NBC. \\u201cI mean, no one is above the law. \\u201d And for Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s allies, the word of the day was \\u201cpuzzled\\u201d  \\u2014   the descriptor top Clinton surrogates wielded repeatedly as they implied, without quite saying, that Mr. Comey had staged an unforgivable political intervention late in the presidential race. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just extremely puzzling,\\u201d said Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s running mate, on \\u201cThis Week\\u201d on ABC. \\u201cI just have no way of understanding these actions. They\\u2019re completely unprecedented and that\\u2019s why I think he owes the American public more information. \\u201d The stakes of the clash, muddled as it is, are plainly higher for Democrats: Mrs. Clinton had led consistently in polls ahead of Mr. Comey\\u2019s announcement, and appeared close to having a firm lock on the 270 Electoral College votes required for victory. Only a late plot twist, it seemed, might be capable of undoing her advantage. It is unclear whether Mr. Comey\\u2019s actions could amount to such an unforeseen turn. Mr. Comey, who notified Congress on Friday that information from a separate case prompted the fresh review of Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s emails, has not offered any additional comment on the matter. Government officials have described the F. B. I. \\u2019s new information as emerging from an investigation into allegations that Anthony D. Weiner, a former congressman married to Huma Abedin, one of Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s closest aides, exchanged sexually themed messages with a teenager. Clinton allies repeatedly accused Mr. Comey of breaching Justice Department protocols by commenting on a confidential inquiry so close to an election, and expressed bewilderment at his conduct. Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s campaign manager, adopted the same phrasing, describing the campaign as \\u201cso puzzled\\u201d by Mr. Comey\\u2019s actions. He lamented that Mr. Comey had opened the floodgates to wild speculation by offering such a nonspecific announcement. \\u201cThe issue here is, if he doesn\\u2019t come out and get all the information on the table, he\\u2019s going to let anyone  \\u2014   any conspiracy theory  \\u2014   take the day,\\u201d Mr. Mook said on \\u201cMeet the Press. \\u201d But Mr. Mook said he did not expect the F. B. I. director\\u2019s unusual action to cost Mrs. Clinton the election. On the contrary, Mr. Mook said Mrs. Clinton was faring well in early voting and could lock down one or more swing states, starting with Nevada, before Election Day. A smattering of new polling information released on Sunday painted a mixed picture of the race in its final days, with Mrs. Clinton consistently holding an advantage but of uncertain size. It is likely too soon to see any direct effect from Friday\\u2019s events, casting additional uncertainty over the importance of the latest revelations. Still, an ABC   Post tracking poll showed Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s advantage nationally slipping to just one percentage point, in a dramatic narrowing over the past week. And a New York   College poll showed Mr. Trump retaking the lead in Florida. But polling from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, conducted by Marist College, found Mrs. Clinton faring better in Florida, ahead of Mr. Trump there by one point, and leading him by six points in North Carolina. Mr. Trump is spending several of the few days left in the race campaigning well outside the traditional band of states that decide presidential elections. He was campaigning on Sunday in New Mexico and plans on Monday to be in Michigan  \\u2014   two solidly blue states where polling has shown Mrs. Clinton with a clear lead.\"\n        ],\n
